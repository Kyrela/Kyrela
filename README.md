### **Hello ! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm Kyrela, a french IT student at @Epitech !
I code mainly in C/Python.
I am interested in software programming, as well as chatbots (Discord bots, for exemple)
I spend my free time programming, playing video games, listening to music or reading.
I am eager to learn and want to progress as much as possible!

## My Actual Projects ðŸ’¾

I don't have much time to devote to my personal projects because of the work I have to do for my studies, but here is a list of the projects I am doing on a personal basis:
- A personnal lib and core for programmaing with discord.py, named [discore](https://github.com/Kyrela/discore)
- 2-3 Discord Bots, one for personal use, a second for fun on a friend's server, and a third for wishing birthdays to server members
- A site with github-pages that would serve as a portfolio for all my projects (not started yet)
- I also give a hand to other people on the projects

## My Pasts Projects

My most interesting past projects are the ones I post here in open-source: check them out!

## My projects realized during my studies ðŸŽ“

I also plan to make them open-source, but it's impossible for me as long as I'm a student at Epitech. In the meantime, you can watch some of the most important videos on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_LBIzGKG91pmLLh9bnXrA) channel.
