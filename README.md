### **Hello ! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm Kyrela, a french IT student at @Epitech !
I code mainly in Python/C/C++/C#/Ruby.
I am interested in video game programming, software programming, as well as chatbots (Discord bots, for exemple)
I spend my free time programming, playing video games, listening to music or reading.
I am eager to learn and want to progress as much as possible!

## My Actual Projects ðŸ’¾

I don't have much time to devote to my personal projects because of the work I have to do for my studies, but here is a list of the projects I am currently doing on a personal basis:
- A Discord bot aiming to improve social medias embeds, named [FixTweetBot](https://github.com/Kyrela/FixTweetBot)
- A personnal lib and core for programming with discord.py, named [discore](https://github.com/Kyrela/discore)
- I also give a hand to other people on source-available projects


## My projects realized during my studies ðŸŽ“

Most of them are currently non-public, but I actually work on video games build with Unreal Engine 5. You can have a look at some of them at [Itch.io](https://kyrela.itch.io/)!
